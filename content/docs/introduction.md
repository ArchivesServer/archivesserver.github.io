The giant space elevator transformed the solar system into a new frontier of opportunity. A city was built on the Moon, and Mars was colonized. Around the base of the Bean-stalk grew the megapolis of New Angeles, officially home to half a billion people (and perhaps as many more unofficially), and the headquarters for the megacorporations that created the Network, the arcologies, and the androids.

Humans have come a long way since the dark ages. Cybernetic implants, gene therapy, and AI in every pocket ensure that life is pleasant, convenient, and long for those who can afford it. But beneath the cracks in the veneer there’s still poverty, crime, and war, and dozens of societal scapegoats.

Androids intelligent synthetic life-forms walk the streets and work the jobs too dangerous or onerous for humans. They’re taking away jobs from flesh-and-blood workers, redefining what it means to be rich and poor - even challenging the definition of what it means to be human.

And there’s more of them every year.{space}{space}
