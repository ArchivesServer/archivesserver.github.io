## A

**ACM (Anti-Clone Movement)**: An informal tag for a growing number of organizations including groups who see clones solely as competition for human workers as well as groups who want to grant clones the same rights as human beings.

**Agroplex**: An extremely large farm factory, from “agricultural complex.” Much of the former rain forest of eastern Ecuador, southern Columbia, and western Brazil is now devoted to agroplexes in order to feed New Angeles’ inhabitants.

**Airbelt pack**: Device used by authorized personnel, such as security forces, to maneuver in zero-G interiors, such as within the Midway Station complex. It consists of two jet packs worn at the center of gravity, one in front, one behind, and controlled by a small virtual panel above the front unit. It draws in air and expels it in a jet, so it cannot be used in vacuum.

**AIVM (Accelerated in Vitro Maturation)**: The vat-growing technique used by Jinteki to rapidly mature clone specimens from zygote to adult.

**Android**: An artificially intelligent humanoid construct. Androids are distinct from robots or other constructs because androids possess “strong” AI. There are two known types of androids: synthetic bioroids and organic clones.

**Anglo**: A broad term for an English - or American-speaking culture, especially from the mainland United States and Atlantica.

**Arcology or “ark”**: A “city-in-a-building.” Tall structures, rising as much as a thousand stories or more, sometimes called “towers.” Arcologies house a community complete with offices, schools, shops, malls, an internal security force, and everything else required for living. Generally used by upper-middle class to upper class, arks are a feature of all megacities, including New Angeles. Often resented by lower classes, who aren’t allowed inside.

 **AI (Artificial intelligence)**: Createdintelligence, usually in the form of a machine or program. So-called “weak” AI (also known as “simulated intel-ligence” or “SI”), while sophisticated and sometimes convincingly realistic, falls short of true human-level intellect. “Strong” AI, or true intelligence, is currently only possible by utilizing brainmapping technology to emulate a human brain. Androids are the primary application of strong AI.

## B

**Backscatter or “backscat”**: For backscatter X-ray. Also called “peek-a-boo” units. Security device that renders a subject nude on-screen in order to detect weapons or packages hidden beneath clothing. Modern refinements include the capacity to use focused ultrasound beams to search body cavities and internal organs as well. 

**Bangers, also “streetbangers”**: Youth gangs common in the megacities. Often engaged in criminal activity, especially illicit drugs and sexies, and may go on crime sprees just for thrills.

**Beanstalk, aka “New Angeles Space Ele-
vator”**: An approximately 72,000km tall elevator construct tethered in New Angeles. Its stations include the Root (aka “Earth Station”), Midway, and the Castle (aka “Challenger Planetoid”). A cost-effective way to reach Earth orbit and points beyond. Named for the story of Jack and the Beanstalk and the man who built it, Jack Weyland.

**Bioplas**: Biodegradable plastic commonly used in packaging and disposables.

**Bioroid**: A type of android manufactured by Haas-Bioroid. Bioroids are robotic humanoids built of metal, plastic, silicon, and other synthetic materials. Their artificially intelligent brains are neurally channeled from braintapes derived from human brains.

**Blackout, the**: A period of global disruption to regional networks that precipitated a sharp market downturn. The more secure architecture of SYNC’s Network eventually replaced the Internet as a result.

**Brain-machine interface or “BMI”**: A device that allows direct communication between a user’s brain and a computer system. Commonly in the
form of a so-called “brain-net” (for a wearable BMI) or a “skulljack” (a BMI cybernetically implanted in the user’s brain). BMIs are a new technology originally developed by the military. The first consumer-grade models are just entering the marketplace, and they are most popular among Netcriminals and the younger generation.

**Brainmapping and braintaping**: Brain mapping technology was developed to scan the human brain to aid with the diagnosis and study of brain disorders. It has now become a general term for brain scans of many types. Braintaping is a specialized, extremely detailed application of brainmapping technology that allows the user to develop a working (but currently imperfect) copy of the original brain. Both technologies are essential for the creation of strong AI and androids.

**Brain-net**: A type of BMI that is worn over the top of the skull. Brain-nets often resemble a “net” of threads linking contacts that are placed on the skull. Sometimes the net is built into a helmet, hood, or other piece of headgear.

**Buckminsterfullerene**, also “bucky balls”: A carbon molecule (C60) with a number of unique properties. The term “buckyballs” has become the root of a number of terms for nano-scale carbon assemblages. Named for Buckminster Fuller, whose architectural designs resemble the shape of the molecule.

**Buckyfilm**: A frictionless surface comprised of buckyballs, nano-scale carbon-atom spheres in an electrical field matrix.

**Buckyweave**: A type of material, immensely strong, consisting of woven, open-ended buckytubes—carbon atoms in tube form. The space elevator began as a buckyweave strap lowered from synchorbit to the top of Cayambe.

**Burnout**: Popular term for a person burned out by drugs, drink, or BMI malfunction.
