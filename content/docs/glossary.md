## A

**ACM (Anti-Clone Movement)**: An informal tag for a growing number of organizations including groups who see clones solely as competition for human workers as well as groups who want to grant clones the same rights as human beings.

**Agroplex**: An extremely large farm factory, from “agricultural complex.” Much of the former rain forest of eastern Ecuador, southern Columbia, and western Brazil is now devoted to agroplexes in order to feed New Angeles’ inhabitants.

**Airbelt pack**: Device used by authorized personnel, such as security forces, to maneuver in zero-G interiors, such as within the Midway Station complex. It consists of two jet packs worn at the center of gravity, one in front, one behind, and controlled by a small virtual panel above the front unit. It draws in air and expels it in a jet, so it cannot be used in vacuum.

**AIVM (Accelerated in Vitro Maturation)**: The vat-growing technique used by Jinteki to rapidly mature clone specimens from zygote to adult.

**Android**: An artificially intelligent humanoid construct. Androids are distinct from robots or other constructs because androids possess “strong” AI. There are two known types of androids: synthetic bioroids and organic clones.

**Anglo**: A broad term for an English - or American-speaking culture, especially from the mainland United States and Atlantica.

**Arcology or “ark”**: A “city-in-a-building.” Tall structures, rising as much as a thousand stories or more, sometimes called “towers.” Arcologies house a community complete with offices, schools, shops, malls, an internal security force, and everything else required for living. Generally used by upper-middle class to upper class, arks are a feature of all megacities, including New Angeles. Often resented by lower classes, who aren’t allowed inside.

 **AI (Artificial intelligence)**: Createdintelligence, usually in the form of a machine or program. So-called “weak” AI (also known as “simulated intel-ligence” or “SI”), while sophisticated and sometimes convincingly realistic, falls short of true human-level intellect. “Strong” AI, or true intelligence, is currently only possible by utilizing brainmapping technology to emulate a human brain. Androids are the primary application of strong AI.
