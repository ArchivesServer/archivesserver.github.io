## A

**ACM (Anti-Clone Movement)**: An informal tag for a growing number of organizations including groups who see clones solely as competition for human workers as well as groups who want to grant clones the same rights as human beings.

**Agroplex**: An extremely large farm factory, from “agricultural complex.” Much of the former rain forest of eastern Ecuador, southern Columbia, and western Brazil is now devoted to agroplexes in order to feed New Angeles’ inhabitants.

**Airbelt pack**: Device used by authorized personnel, such as security forces, to maneuver in zero-G interiors, such as within the Midway Station complex. It consists of two jet packs worn at the center of gravity, one in front, one behind, and controlled by a small virtual panel above the front unit. It draws in air and expels it in a jet, so it cannot be used in vacuum.
