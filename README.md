# About

I am a long time table-top gamer and IT nerd, that loves exploring new games and technology. Which is why the subject matter of this site appeals to me so much. As I begin this adventure digging deeper into the lore of Android and Netrunner, I decided to create and research this project to document my journey and provide an ongoing resource for others. I don't know how long this will take me or whether I'll ever finish, but I'm looking forward to the discoveries along the way... while also learning more about Git and markdown.
